    "1. A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing a random subset of these visitors to a new site design. Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of visitors who would register for the website under the new design using the normal distribution.\n",
    "2. A study examined the average pay for a random sample of men and women entering the workforce as doctors for 21 different positions. If each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. In the study, men were, on average, paid more in 17 of the 21 positions. Complete a hypothesis test (two-sided or one-sided, just be clear which you are reporting) to examine whether there is significant evidence (at the 0.05 level) of gender discrimination in pay in these positions. Report your p-value and interpret the result."

    "3. Consider the null hypothesis that female and male users are equally likely to rate `Star Wars (1977)` a `5`. Conduct a two-sided t test using [`stats.ttest_ind_from_stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind_from_stats.html) to evaluate this in light of the sample data of female and male users who rated `Star Wars (1977)`. Report your p-value and interpret it at a significance level of 0.05. You should observe a different p-value than in step 2 despite the hypotheses under consideration being ostensibly similar. Briefly explain why you observe this difference."

    "1. Using a two-sided t-test, we find that p-value = 0.066 > confidence level = 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the average ratings for male and female reviewers are the same. \n",

    "2. Using a two-sided t-test, we find that p-value = 0.119 > confidence level = 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that 51% of male users rate Star Wars a 5. \n",

    "3. Using a two-sided t-test, we find that p-value = 2.404224741555527e-85 < confidence level = 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that female and male users are equally likely to rate star wars a 5 and accept the alternative hypothesis that female and male users are unequally likely to rate star wars a 5. The reason why the p-value found in 4.3 differs so much with the p-value found in 4.2 is that the null hypotheses are innately different. According to data trends, we can notice that it is much more likely for female and male users to rate star wars a 5 at a different rate. "
