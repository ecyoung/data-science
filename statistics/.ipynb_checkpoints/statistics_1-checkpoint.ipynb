    "### Question 1\n",
    "The General Social Survey asked the following question to a random sample of 1,155 Americans: “After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?” A 95% confidence interval for the mean number of hours spent relaxing or pursuing activities they enjoy was (1.38, 1.92).\n",
    "1. Your friend reads the survey and says it means \"95% of the survey respondents reported between 1.38 and 1.92 hours.\" Is this a valid interpretation of the confidence interval? Why or why not?\n",
    "2. Suppose another set of researchers reported a confidence interval of (1.29, 2.01) based on the same sample of 1,155 Americans. Is this indicative of a higher or lower confidence level (the percentage)?\n",
    "3. Suppose next year a new survey asking the same question is conducted, and this time the sample size\n",
    "is 2,500. Assuming that the summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) are roughly the same as before, how will the new confidence interval differ from the (1.38, 1.92) computed before? Why?"

    "### Answer 1\n",
    "1. This is not a valid interpretation of the confidence interval, because a 95% confidence interval does not mean 95% of the data points falls within the interval. Instead, it means that if repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, 95% of the intervals would contain the population mean. A 95% confidence interval has a 0.95 probability of containing the population mean. 95% of the population distribution is contained in the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This is indicative of a higher confidence level, because the sample sample size is taken but the interval is widened from (1.38, 1.92) to (1.29, 2.01), so it is more likely for the true parameter to fall into the new interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The new confidence interval will be narrower, because as shown by the confidence interval formula CI = Xbar +/- z(s/sqrt(n)), an increase in n decreases the two-way distance between xbar and the two separate ends of the confidence interval.  "

    "Below we import the `university_data` dataset we have looked at before. It contains information about 311 universities in the United States. In general, private universities charge higher tuition rates than public universities. However, private universities often argue that once you take financial aid into account, the cost is often not different. In this question you will explore this issue.\n",
    "1. First, report the average `tuition` of `public` schools and the average `tuition` of `private` schools to confirm the basic notion that `private` schools charge higher tuition on average.\n",
    "2. Consider the null hypothesis that `private` and `public` universities have the same average `cost_after_aid`. Conduct a two-sided t-test to determine whether the dataset provides statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis that they have different average `cost_after_aid`. You will notice that some universities do not have a value recorded for `cost_after_aid`. For now, simply omit those universities from your analysis and assume that the remaining are a random sample of American universities. Report the resulting p-value. Interpret your results at a significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "3. In the previous step you tested for statistical significance of the difference in `cost_after_aid` between public and private schools. What is the effect size? Report the average `cost_after_aid` of `public` schools and the average `cost_after_aid` of `private` schools.\n",
    "4. In step 2 we assumed that we could omit the universities with missing data and the remainder would be a random sample of American universities. Is that assumption well justified? Consider especially the average values you computed in steps 1 and 3 and consider which universities are missing the `cost_after_aid` information. Given this, what can you say about the claim that \"private universities often argue that once you take financial aid into account, the cost is often not different?\""

    "1. Average public tuition: 25968.97894736842, Average private tuition: 40871.0350877193\n",
    "2. The p-value of the two-sided test is 0.000314, which is less than our confidence level of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that average public tuition cost-after-aid is the same as average private tuition cost-after-aid. \n",
    "3. Effect Size: 4515.956964006258\n",
    "4. The assumption is not well justified because the universities that do not offer aid usually have low tuition costs themselves. The average cost-after-aid for public universities is even higher than the average tuition of public universities that don't offer aid. "
