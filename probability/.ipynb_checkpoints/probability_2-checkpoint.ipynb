Recall that you can use LaTeX to nicely format your math inside Markdown cellsby enclosing equations in single dollar signs (e.g., $x^2+4=8$) for inline math or double dollar signs for centered equations like $$P(X > 5) = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n",

    "### Question 5\n",
    "In the US presidential election, there are typically two candidates: a Democratic candidate and a Republican candidate. Each state has a number of electoral college votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state receives all of the electoral college votes for that particular state (there are a couple of exceptions, but to keep things simple we will assume this is how it works for all states). A candidate who wins at least 270 electoral college votes wins the national election. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *The Data*\n",
    "Below we import the `polls.csv` dataset describing the 2020 US presidential election and preview the first few rows. For each of the 50 states in the USA plus Washington D.C. (which has electoral college votes like a state), the dataset records:\n",
    "- `d_percent`: The percent of polled voters indicating they will vote for the Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential election.\n",
    "- `r_percent`: The percent of polled voters indicating they will vote for the Republican candidate in the 2020 presidential election.\n",
    "- `ec_weight`: The number of electoral college votes controlled by the particular state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *What you will do*\n",
    "**In this question, you will write a Monte Carlo simulation to understand the probabilities of the following three events.** This is based roughly on the idea of computational models for predicting election outcomes such as those you may have seen recently in the news. \n",
    "- $D$: the Democratic candidate wins at least 270 electoral college votes (and thus the presidential election)\n",
    "- $R$: the Republican candidate wins at least 270 electoral college votes (and thus the presidential election) \n",
    "- $U$: neither candidate gets 270 electoral college votes and the election is undecided.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### *How you will do it*\n",
    "To do so, model the uncertainty in the poll numbers as follows. \n",
    "1. For each simulation, for each state independently, draw 0-mean normally distributed random `noise` for a given standard deviation estimate $\\sigma$. You can do so, for example, using [numpy.random.normal](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html). This reflects the assumption that the poll numbers are not certain and could vary in either direction by one or two standard deviations.\n",
    "2. Add `noise` (independently for each state) to `d_percent` and subtract `noise` from `r_percent`. So if you get `noise = 1.5`, `d_percent = 42`, and `r_percent = 57` you would get `43.5` for the new `d_percent` and `55.5` for the new `r_percent`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then for a given simulation you can check which of $D$, $R$, or $U$ occur by checking, for each state, which candidate gets a larger share of the vote, and adding up their electoral votes accross all of the states. Make sure that each simulation starts with the original values from the `polls` dataset not the results from the previous simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code the simulation and then **run 10,000 simulations for each of the following values of $\\sigma$: 1, 5, and 10. For each, report the empirical probability of the events $D$, $R$, and $U$.** You should therefore report a total of 9 values. It may take a few seconds for your simulations to run, but if they are running for minutes, you are likely writing inefficient loops instead of taking advantage of efficient Pandas and Numpy operations. You will need one loop over the 10,000 simulations but should not need any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: We **strongly recommend** you write a function that runs and returns the results of a single simulation. It’ll make your code easier to write and understand."
